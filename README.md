## Description

When issuing or receiving electronic invoices, it is a good idea to validate
them against the corresponding schemas. One software that you can use for this
purpose is [MustangProject](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/mustangproject) which
comes with a CLI.

The problem with the CLI is that it starts up very slowly and can validate
only one document at a time. This server offers the validation
features of MustangProject as a minimal API.

## Starting the Server

### Released Version

Download a `validator-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar` file from the
[releases page](https://github.com/gflohr/e-invoice-eu-validator/releases).

Then run the server

```shell
PORT=8080 java -jar target/validator-2.16.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

Inspect the sources if you want to run a jar file without dependencies.

### In Development Mode

```shell
mvn clean install
PORT=8080 mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.cantanea.validator.App
```
